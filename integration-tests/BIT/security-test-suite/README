The test for secure policy negotiation has two parts:
1. provider - to be run on the provider side
2. consumer - to be run on the consumer side

3 nodes are used. Their roles are:
- domain authority
- provider
- consumer

Any roles can be grouped into one node. E.g., you can use only one node that
has all 3 roles, i.e., run both parts of test on a combined node (domain
authority + platform).

How to run the test:

Set these properties:

# Tell the provider part of the test which host name and port shall be used for
# service file sharing.
# This should be the host and port of the domain authority REST server, as seen
# from service consumer side. Obviously, localhost is fine only if you will run
# the consumer part of test on the domain authority node.
test.security.daRestUrl=http://localhost:8080

# Tell the consumer part of the test which identity is the provider.
# On that node the provider part of the test should be run.
test.security.providerJid=admin.societies.local

Run the provider part. Wait for the test end.

Run the consumer part.
