/**
 * The ResponseItem class represents the response to a RequestItem contained in the RequestPolicy of a service provider. 
 * It is constructed after the privacy preference evaluation has been performed and the system can decide to permit or deny the request. 
 * The ResponseItem contains the requestItem object and a Decision flag. The Decision flag can be any of the types listed in the Decision enumeration. 
 * INDETERMINATE suggests that the RequestItem has be altered per the user's wishes (such as adding extra conditions or removing an action) 
 * and needs to be accepted by the service provider. NOT_APPLICABLE suggests that the piece of data the RequestItem refers to does not exist 
 * as a type in the CSS (for example a service may request access to room temperature but the CSS does not have such a type in the system 
 * because the CSS has no temperature sensor )
