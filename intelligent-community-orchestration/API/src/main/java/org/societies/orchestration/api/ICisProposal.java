 * This is a convenient way to store and pass around data on a CIS that could be created.
 * For configuration and deletion of CISs, where existing CISs are involved, the ICisProposal should
 * still be used to pass suggestions to Community Lifecycle Management, but whenever an ICisProposal
 * is used to represent a CIS that already exists, use the 'setActualCis' method to have it store
 * the CIS. 
 * 
 * NOTE: if a suggestion is being made to change an existing CIS's attributes, then
 * create an ICisProposal and invoke 'setActualCis' for the CIS as it is now, and create another ICisProposal
 * and don't use setActualCis, but instead set all the attributes on the ICisProposal
 * for the CIS as you want it to become, with the new attributes.
