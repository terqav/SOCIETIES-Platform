If any method of your Bean returns a value, you will need to add a property for that
value below. You can double up your return values if they are the same object type 
eg, 
The CalculatorBean returns an int for both the Add() and Subtract() method. We use the generic 
int getResult() 

We don't need to add a method for each
int getAddResult() 
int getSubtractResult()
