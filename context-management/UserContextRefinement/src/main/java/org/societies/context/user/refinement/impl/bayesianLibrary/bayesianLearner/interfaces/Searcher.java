 * The searcher communicates with the SearchConsumer via a callback method notifyNewSearchResult() when new candidates
 * are found.
 * 
 * Implemementations can call  the appropriate initialise() method automatically in their constructor!
 * 
 * Searcher distinguishes between the best found Candidate and Candidates that have a score
 * (almost) as good as the best one, in order to find equivalent search results: see SearchConsumer.
