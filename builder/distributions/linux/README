Societies Virgo Linux instructions

In order to run the Virgo Container with a a relevant Societies distribution the following steps are required:

1. The $VIRGO_HOME/bin/dmk.sh script needs to modified according to https://redmine.ict-societies.eu/projects/sp/wiki/Linux_Configuration#Linux-Virgo-start-script-dmksh

2. Set the JAVA_OPTS environmental variable to -XX:MaxPermSize=128m. There are two ways of achieving this:

a. insert the following fragment into the start of the $VIRGO_HOME/bin/startup.sh

#increase the PermGen size to allow the Virgo Societies platform to deploy and work correctly
export JAVA_OPTS=-XX:MaxPermSize=128m

b. Run the setenv.sh (included in current directory) as follows:

source setenv.sh

Running it as ./setenv.sh or sh setenv.sh will set the variable only for the shell in which the script run and only for the duration of the running of the script

3. It is currently not possible to run a multi-container Societies Virgo deployment on Linux as described in Societies Windows documentation.
