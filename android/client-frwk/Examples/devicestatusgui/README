This an Android GUI to test how to manage devices in an Android smartphone:
* battery status,
* connectivity providers status;
* location provider status,
* and so on.
This may duplicate functionality of the Device Manager component and will require discussion with the responsible team. 

Please run: "mvn site" to generate the documentation (in target/doc).
